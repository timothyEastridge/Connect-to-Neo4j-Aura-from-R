# Connect to Neo4j-Aura from R
## Visualize Neo4j data in R with the VisNetwork package

The R programming language offers advanced visualization tools for "classic" data analysis with libraries like ggplot2 and plotly.

To visualize knowledge graph data stored in Neo4j, the R community created two terrific free, open-source libraries:  visNetwork and igraph.  Neo4j supports a Python driver.  I use this Python driver to render a plot of the knowledge graph in R.
