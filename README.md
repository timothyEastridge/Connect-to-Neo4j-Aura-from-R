# Connect to Neo4j-Aura from R
### Visualize Neo4j data in R with the VisNetwork package

The R community created two wonderful free, open-source libraries to visualize knowledge graphs:  visNetwork and igraph. The most popular graph-database is Neo4j, and Neo4j supports a Python driver.  I use this Neo4j-supported Python driver here to render a plot of knowledge graphs in the R programming language.
